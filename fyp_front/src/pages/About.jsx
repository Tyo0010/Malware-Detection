                    <p> This project is designed as a Final Year Project. The goal of this project is to create a simple detection system for ordinary users. Each user can access this software. The principle of operation of this software is signature-based detection. Malware Detection System (MDS) has a pre-installed database in which malware signatures are stored. After the user selects the file that he wants to check, the program reads the file in binary format and then convects it into hexademic. As soon as the conversion is over, the program compares the result with the database for the presence of malicious signatures.</p>

                    The development was done by Pak Artem, who is a student of Asia Pacific University.
